                    standard and who creates his or her own“weird culture” to
                    give him/herself a sense of belonging. The process of making
                    a “weird culture”is very straightforward: the WCK takes bits
                    and pieces of the traditional and nation-state cultures that
                    s/he’s previously experienced while growing up and mix
                    everything together to create his/her own customized
                    culture. These customized cultures are deemed “weird”
                    because, objectively, there are many different and
                    conflicting elements within it, but somehow for the WCK in
                    question, things just seem to fit and to flow.

                    Weird culture kids were once children who grew up in
                    international school systems or in foreign host countries
                    and cultures. They are kids of international and biracial
                    couples, kids of immigrants who grew up in a place— be it
                    school systems or countries— where they don’t feel
                    completely belonging to the culture that they were raised
                    in.

            Weird Culture Kids is a memoir about growing up in and between different cultures
            and experiencing the world through international lenses. It goes deep into the
            author’s journey from birth to adolescence, navigating into the different cultures she
            lived in, encountered with and consciously chose as part of her identity. Sprinkled
            with conversations with other, culturally-speaking, Weirdos, this book gives
            insights into coping mechanisms for displacement / change / relocation / a mobile
            life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nguyễn explores questions around cultures, identities and belonging, such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Can you be ‘from’ a place?</li>
            <li>What happens when part of your identity disappears?</li>
            <li>What’s the relationship between language and identity?</li>
            <li>What does the question ‘where are you from?’ even mean?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You’ll discover you don’t have to belong to a physical man-made piece of land or a
            nation-state. You can belong to people, cities and memories. You can belong to a
            shared habit, a song or a dance routine.
          </p>
          <p>
            And most importantly, you belong in that peaceful state of Acceptance that is nested
            somewhere deep within you.

            Ngọc (Bi) Nguyễn was born in Moscow, Russia, raised in Hanoi, Vietnam, and
            educated in an International French school for twelve years. Aged fifteen, she moved
            to the United States to attend a very Connecticut boarding school. Ever since, she’s
            been asked this simple, yet deeply confusing question: ‘where are you from?’.
            Because she didn’t have any concrete answer to give, Ngọc decided to write a
            memoir about her identity quest.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Weird Culture Kids</i> is her firstborn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Ngọc is committed to build an alternative community for Weird Culture Kids
            through her book. Her story, and that of others shared in this memoir, is a tangible
            proof to demonstrate that beyond her rootlessness, her tribe does, indeed, exist.
