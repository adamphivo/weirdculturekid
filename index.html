                  HARI SELDON â€” . . . born in the 11,988th year of the Galactic
                  Era; died 12,069. The dates are more commonly given in terms
                  of the current Foundational Era as -79 to the year 1 F.E. Born
                  to middle-class parents on Helicon, Arcturus sector (where his
                  father, in a legend of doubtful authenticity, was a tobacco
                  grower in the hydroponic plants of the planet), he early
                  showed amazing ability in mathematics. Anecdotes concerning
                  his ability are innumerable, and some are contradictory. At

                  of psychohistory. Seldon found the field little more than a
                  set of vague axioms; he left it a profound statistical
                  science. . . .

                  his life is the biography written by Gaal Dornick who, as a
                  young man, met Seldon two years before the great
                  mathematician's death. The story of the meeting . . .

                  His name was Gaal Dornick and he was just a country boy who
                  had never seen Trantor before. That is, not in real life.

                  There were nearly twenty-five million inhabited planets in the
                  Galaxy then, and not one but owed allegiance to the Empire
                  whose seat was on Trantor. It was the last half-century in
